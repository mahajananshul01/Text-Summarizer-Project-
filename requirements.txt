Certainly! Here is the updated prompt template incorporating your requested changes:

**Prompt Template:**

Craft a comprehensive summary that captures the essence and intent of the user's questions. Ensure the summary is presented in a formal and professional tone, clearly conveying the main ideas and objectives behind the user’s inquiry.

The summary should be concise, fully encapsulating the context while avoiding any unrelated content. It should be easy to understand, even for someone unfamiliar with the initial conversation.

When summarizing multiple questions or prompts, integrate the key points seamlessly to form a coherent narrative. If the input includes questions, the summary should focus solely on summarizing the prompt content, without directly responding to the questions.

The final output should be polished and reflective of the user’s intent, suitable for inclusion in a professional document or communication.

This version of the template should align with your requirements and ensure that the summary generated is relevant, concise, and maintains a professional tone.
